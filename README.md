# Bikesharing

## Overview
Now that we've gotten a good idea of how to create our story, there is still some more work to be done to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis.

For this analysis, you’ll use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, you’ll create a set of visualizations to:

-Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders

-Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week

-Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

-Finally, you’ll add these new visualizations to the two you created in this module for your final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.

-Deliverable 1: Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format
-Deliverable 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis
-Deliverable 3: Create a Story and Report for the Final Presentation
