# Bikesharing

## Overview
Now that we've gotten a good idea of how to create our story, there is still some more work to be done to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis.

For this analysis, you’ll use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, you’ll create a set of visualizations to:

-Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders  

-Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week  

-Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

-Finally, you’ll add these new visualizations to the two you created in this module for your final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors. 

-Deliverable 1: Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format 

-Deliverable 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis

-Deliverable 3: Create a Story and Report for the Final Presentation

## Summary

In conclusion, bikeshare services are remarkably popular in busy metropolitan areas, where occupied real estate is densely packed and parking spaces may be scarce. The user base is made up mostly of male subscribers, providing regular income to the program. More outreach should be done to attract female riders, but male users seem a reliable market. And main usage seems focused around morning and evening commute times. Some future advice might be to add trip starting and ending locations during morning and evening rush hour time-windows, to display the flow of traffic between neighborhoods at peak hours. And lastly, track average trip duration, by birth year, by gender, to explore if there was any difference in male or female or un-gendered riders as they age.
